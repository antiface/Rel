Rel is an exploration of the relational model and data analysis in Python.

I'm starting off just bringing together code I had on my blog from various
posts in 2005, initial focusing on implementing relations, a few relational
operators and exploring functional dependency analysis.

Still to come is broader support of the relational model, use of namedtuples,
use of itertools, importers and exporters (including possible support for
Django's fixtures format) and more utility functions I have scattered all
over the place in various data analysis scripts I've written over the years.
